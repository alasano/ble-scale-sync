/**
 * Ported from openScale's QNHandler.kt
 *
 * QN / FITINDEX ES-26M style scales (vendor protocol on 0xFFE0 / 0xFFF0).
 *
 * Two very similar layouts:
 *   Type 1 (0xFFE0): FFE1 notify, FFE2 indicate, FFE3 write-config, FFE4 write-time
 *   Type 2 (0xFFF0): FFF1 notify, FFF2 write-shared
 *
 * Some newer firmware (e.g. Renpho ES-CS20M / Elis 1) also exposes an AE00
 * service (AE01 write, AE02 notify) that must be initialized before the scale
 * starts sending measurement data on FFF1.
 *
 * The handshake is notification-driven (matching openScale and the official
 * Renpho app): the scale sends 0x12 (scale info) when FFF1 CCCD is written,
 * and each subsequent command is sent in response to a specific frame:
 *
 *   0x12 (scale info) -> AE01 init (if AE00) -> 0x13 config
 *   0x14 (ready ACK)  -> 0x20 time sync + A2 user profile + "pass" auth
 *   0x21 (config req)  -> A00D history responses + 0x22 start measurement
 *   0x10 (weight)      -> parse weight + 0x1F acknowledge stable reading
 *
 * 0x10 frame (original format, 10 bytes):
 *   [3-4]   weight (BE uint16, / weightScaleFactor)
 *   [5]     stability (1 = stable, 0 = measuring)
 *   [6-7]   resistance R1 (BE uint16)
 *   [8-9]   resistance R2 (BE uint16)
 *
 * 0x10 frame (ES-30M format, 14 bytes, weightScaleFactor=10):
 *   [4]     state (0x00=measuring, 0x01=stabilizing, 0x02=stable)
 *   [5-6]   weight (BE uint16, / weightScaleFactor)
 *   [7-8]   resistance R1 (BE uint16)
 *   [9-10]  resistance R2 (BE uint16)
 *
 * 0x12 frame (scale info, classic 11-byte format):
 *   [2]     protocol type (echoed back in all config commands)
 *   [10]    weight scale flag (1 = /100, else /10)
 *
 * 0x12 frame (long format, byte[1] == packet length):
 *   [1]     length (18 on the Renpho ES-26M, 20 on the GE CS 10 G)
 *   [2]     protocol/verify byte (0xff on every captured frame)
 *   [3-8]   MAC address, little endian
 *   Weight scale factor is 10 (ES-30M format with heuristic /100 fallback).
 *
 *   The two dialects agree on the layout and differ in the value the firmware
 *   ACCEPTS BACK. The 18-byte ES-26M was hardware verified rejecting 0xff and
 *   working on 0x00 (45e4d6e); on the 20-byte GE CS 10 G the vendor app echoes
 *   0xff, and its 0x22 start command is then byte identical to ours (#235).
 *   Note that only the 0x22 matches the app byte for byte: the app's 0x13 and
 *   0x20 are each one byte longer than ours, and that delta is still unexplained.

 * Completed-weigh-in result frames on the extended dialect (#235).

 * The 20-byte GE CS 10 G / "Fit Plus" does NOT stream 0x10 live frames after a
 * full body-composition weigh-in. Once the impedance sweep finishes it sends a
 * burst of result frames the adapter had been dropping at the ignore branch, so
 * the handshake succeeded end to end yet nothing ever reached the exporters:
 *
 *   0xB1 .. 03 01 : live sweep record, 44 bytes. THE weight source.
 *       [5-6]   weight, LE uint16, /100 kg
 *       [7..]   impedance channels
 *   0xB4 .. 04 01 : stored history record, 44 bytes. Weight only when fresh.
 *       [7-10]  record timestamp, LE uint32 (scale 2000-epoch)
 *       [11-12] recorded weight, LE uint16, /100 kg
 *       [13..]  impedance channels, all zero on a record the scale has not
 *               finished computing
 *
 * The 0xB4 was originally read as the authoritative final weight. It is not: it
 * is a HISTORY record, and the timestamp at [7] proves it. In @hedoric's own
 * three-connect log the first connect's 0xB4 carries 67.10 kg stamped six days
 * earlier with an all-zero impedance body, while the 0xB1 in the same burst
 * carries the live 75.25 kg; the third connect's 0xB4 is stamped 178 seconds
 * before the session began, which is the PREVIOUS connect's weigh-in. Preferring
 * 0xB4 therefore publishes a stale weight, and on that first connect it would
 * have exported 67.10 kg to Garmin for a 75 kg user. The middle connect sends no
 * 0xB4 at all, so 0xB1 is not a fallback in any case: it is the live value.
 *
 * The 0xB4 is still accepted when its timestamp is inside the same freshness
 * window the 0x23 stored records use, since a genuinely current record is the
 * scale's own averaged figure. Anything older is left to the stored-record path,
 * which exists for exactly that.
 *
 * @hedoric hardware-verified the live values against the scale's own display:
 * 75.20 kg, BMI 20.2 in the 0xB1 03 03 tail, cross-checked as
 * 75.20 / 1.93^2 = 20.19. Every frame carries the standard QN trailing sum.
 *
 * Impedance is deliberately NOT forwarded to the BIA estimator yet. The channels
 * are a proprietary multi-frequency segmental sweep in raw units (~2,300-3,050),
 * not the single ~500 ohm whole-body value computeBiaFat expects (it divides
 * height^2 / impedance), and feeding one in raw yields a ~57% fat nonsense.
 * Until the channels are calibrated the reading is emitted weight-only, so body
 * composition falls back to the same profile-based estimate broadcast-only
 * scales already use. Weight and BMI are the parts this decode is sure of.
